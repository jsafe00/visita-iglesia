Your love remains with us in the Eucharist, this love we receive in every Communion when we eat your precious Body and drink your sacred Blood. This is the great manifesto of your love for us.',

      'Teach us to show greater love for you in the Holy Sacrifice. Make us receive you in a greater disposition, prepared and in the state of grace. Everytime we sin against you, help us to be sorry first for our iniquities before we accept you in Communion. Make every moment a loving one with your divine presence in us. And when the priest tells us, Ite, Missa Est, guide us as we become a living Eucharist of love to our brothers and sisters, even to the point of offering our lives for you and for them. Amen.'

Many were led astray due to their false interpretations of the Sacrament which you alone provide. This gave much offense to your Eucharistic Presence, dear Lord.',

      'Accept our sincere act of repentance for these and others wrongdoings of the world, Lord Jesus. We promise to express our deep concern and love for this memorial of your saving work for us. This might lead us to become the enemies of the world, but we know you’ll never leave us and that you’ll provide the Consoling Spirit that will make us energized and prepared to defend your precious Body in words and actions. Guide us, O Lord. We depend on your providence. Amen.'
